        Yes, literally. A. Useless. Number. Game. I honestly don't know how I can put it to you any more clearer than that. Okay, there are basic arithmetic questions and you push some buttons to answer and you get a score and blah blah blah. Seriously though, unless you are super dumb and super bored, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anyone. Just do something more productive and you'll be fine, my friend. And for the record, this is a Google font, not freaking Comic Sans.
