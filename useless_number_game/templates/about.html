        Yes. It's. Literally. A. Useless. Number. Game.
        I honestly don't know how I can put it to you any more clearer than that.
        There's basic arithmetic questions and you push some buttons to answer and you get a score. Period.
        Seriously though, unless you are catastrophically dumb or life-threateningly bored, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anyone.
        Just do something more productive and you'll be fine.
        And for the record, this is a Google font, not goddamn Comic Sans.
